# Cyber-Security

Final Project of **IBM Edunet Cybersecurity Internship**

## Project Title

**Steganography – Hiding Text Under Image**

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the IBM Edunet Foundation Cybersecurity internship (6 weeks). The goal is to build a steganography system that securely hides encrypted text messages within digital images. The tool ensures hidden data remains undetectable to unauthorized users while maintaining image quality.

## Libraries Used

- `Tkinter` — GUI (built-in with Python)
- `Pillow` — Image handling
- `PyCryptodome` — AES-EAX encryption/decryption
- `Numpy` — Pixel data handling
- `OpenCV` _(optional)_ — Edge detection
- `Base64` — Encoding and decoding

## How to Use

Encryption

1️⃣ Ensure `encryption.py` is in the same directory as your input image.  
2️⃣ Run:

python encryption.py
3️⃣ Enter your secret message and password when prompted.
4️⃣ The tool generates encryptedImage.jpg with the hidden message.

1️⃣ Ensure decryption.py is in the same directory as your encrypted image.
2️⃣ Run:
python decryption.py
3️⃣ Enter your password when prompted.
4️⃣ The tool displays the hidden message if the password is correct.

Deployment
